Michael Hayden wrote <a href=https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/19/opinion/hayden-snowden-impact/index.html>this</a> about Edward Snowden,<blockquote><p>But it takes a special kind of arrogance for this young man to believe that his moral judgment on the dilemma suddenly trumps that of two (incredibly different) presidents, both houses of the U.S. Congress, both political parties, the U.S. court system and more than 30,000 of his co-workers.</blockquote><p>You know what else takes a special kind of arrogance? The Obama administration <a href=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/house-nsa-repeal-vote/>describing</a> the Amash amendment to end the NSA’s (formerly) secret spying program with, “This blunt approach is not the product of an informed, open, or deliberative process.” There’s nothing open or <a href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/06/18/obama-charlie-rose-program-nsa-surveillance/2433549/>transparent</a> about a secret court creating secret laws based solely on the arguments presented by the government.<p>And for the record, Gen. Hayden, 205 members of the House of Representatives voted to end this program. Mr. Snowden is not alone.</div><div class=post-footer><p class=post-meta>Last updated <time datetime=2013-07-26T00:00:00+00:00 property=dateModified>Jul 26, 2013</time>.</div></article></main>
