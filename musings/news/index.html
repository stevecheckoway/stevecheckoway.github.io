Sure, my name didn’t actually appear in the article, but I had no complaints. After all, it’s not every day people outside of computer science actually care about my research. I know, it’s shocking that the general public doesn’t care about <a href=/papers/iccd2006/>trace caches</a> or <a href=/papers/noret_ccs2010/>return-oriented programming without returns</a>, but that’s just the world we live in.<p>But that’s not what this is about.<p>Recently, I was reminded that I appeared in a <a href=http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_1b032d6c-ab73-51ed-9b75-333857842f61.html>newspaper</a> half a decade earlier—that’s right, <em>The Daily</em>, UW’s daily student newspaper—and in a much different context: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo>Kendo</a>, the Japanese martial art. As I recall, I was just about to don my armor for my first match of the day (and the only match of the day as I was promptly eliminated without scoring a single point), when I was asked what I enjoyed about Kendo. At this point, I uttered the immortal words, “It’s fun, it’s exercise, and you get to hit people in the head.” Truer words were never spoken.<p>If you haven’t experienced the joy of hitting people in the head with bamboo swords, I highly recommend it.</div><div class=post-footer><p class=post-meta>Last updated <time datetime=2011-07-02T00:00:00-04:00 property=dateModified>Jul 2, 2011</time>.</div></article></main>
