Duplicity’s legacy Pexpect SSH backend is an order of magnitude faster than the default Paramiko backend. Posted 2017-12-02. <blockquote>I have been using <a href=http://duplicity.nongnu.org/>Duplicity</a> to back up one of my Linux servers for several years now. Duplicity supports quite a few network protocols for connecting to file servers, including commercial servers like Amazon S3, Google Drive, and Microsoft Azure. For my personal use, I’ve only used its ability to use SSH to back up to a small <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage>NAS</a>. I have not been completely happy with Duplicity, but I have successfully used it to restore data lost from a hard drive failure so I’ve continued using it.

A brief description of the latest TLS 1.3 drama regarding enterprise networks. Posted 2017-07-22. <blockquote>As the TLS 1.3 standardization process (hopefully) comes to a close, there has been some drama on the TLS WG mailing list and at the recent IETF 99 meeting in Prague regarding the use of TLS 1.3 in enterprise networks. This is a surprisingly contentious and important topic that I suspect many people who don't follow protocol development closely may have missed. Below, I'm going to try to describe the various points of view from a (mostly) nontechnical perspective and the arguments that have been advanced. Then, I'll briefly conclude with my thoughts on the topic.<br><a href=/musings/tls13-enterprises/>...</a></blockquote><li><a href=/musings/tweet-images/>Turning tweets into vector images</a>.

Examining a shocking statement that mothers are 100% less likely to be hired than nonmothers. Posted 2012-07-28. <blockquote>A friend of mine pointed me toward a 2011 article <em><a href=http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2011/08/26/womens-equality-day-what-the-heck-do-i-tell-my-daughter/>Women’s Equality Day: What the Heck Do I Tell My Daughter?</a></em> this evening. I found it an interesting read but it contains a sentence that really caught my attention, “Further, studies have found that with EQUAL resumes, women with children are up to 100 percent less likely to be hired than women without children.” This is a shocking statement. It is saying that studies have found that mothers will not be hired if there is an equivalently qualified nonmother.

Today I decided to take a look at a small piece of that puzzle by examining a bootloader for an embedded x86 system I was hoping to reverse engineer at some point in the future. This particular machine runs the pSOS real-time operating system on a 486.
