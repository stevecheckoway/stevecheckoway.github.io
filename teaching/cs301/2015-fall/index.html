<h1>Overview</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="staff.html">Course Staff</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="syllabus.html">Schedule and Readings</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://piazza.com/class/idlrvo78up6qq">Piazza Forum</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Assessment</h1>
<p>Your work will be assessed through three mechanisms: exercises, problem
sets, and exams.
Grades will be determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exercises: 20%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Problem sets: 30%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exams: 50%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>You may collaborate with as many other students in the class as you like on the
exercises. You <i>must</i> write up your solutions on your own.  Exercises will be
collected at the beginning of class on the day they're due and checked off for
completeness but individual problems will not be graded for correctness.
(These do still count toward your grade, so make sure you do them all.)</p>
<p>It is recommended, but not required, that you write up your exercise
solutions in <span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> (see below). A <span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> template for
exercises&nbsp;#1 is <a href="exercises1.tex">here</a>.</p>
<p>Solutions to the exercises (including the <span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> source) will be available on
<a href="https://piazza.com/jhu/spring2015/en600271/resources">Piazza</a> after the due date.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exercises #1: Sipser 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7<br />
Due: Thursday, September 3, 2015.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exercises #2: Sipser 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4ce, 1.5cg, 1.7abcdg<br />
Due: Tuesday, September 15, 2015.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exercises #3: Sipser 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.13, 2.14, 2.17<br />
Due: Tuesday, October 13, 2015</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exercises #4: Sipser 3.4, 3.5, build TMs in JFLAP for 3.8, 3.11<br />
Due: Tuesday, November 10, 2015.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exercises #5: Sipser 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11<br />
Due: Tuesday, November 24, 2015.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem sets</h2>
<p>You must solve the problem sets <i>on your own</i>, without discussing them
with anyone other than course staff. You must write up your solutions
on your own. Further, solutions to problem sets <i>must</i> be written in
<span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> (see below). Problem sets are to be turned in as PDFs on
Blackboard and will be graded for correctness.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problem set #1: <a href="ps1.pdf">ps1.pdf</a><br />
Due: Tuesday, September 22, 2015 at 23:59</p>
</li>
<li><p>Problem set #2: <a href="ps2.pdf">ps2.pdf</a><br />
Due: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 23:59</p>
</li>
<li><p>Problem set #3: <a href="ps3.pdf">ps3.pdf</a><br />
Due: Tuesday, November 17, 2015 at 23:59</p>
</li>
<li><p>Problem set #4: TBA<br />
Due: Friday, Dec 4, 2015 at 23:59</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>There are two, 75-minute, in-class exams at the times listed above.
Each in-class exam is worth 12.5% of your grade. There is a final exam
worth 25% of your grade that will be given on the scheduled final
exam day. The exams are closed book; however, <b>you are allowed to
bring in one sheet of 8.5" by 11" paper filled on both sides with any
information you think you'll need.</b></p>
<p>Any student who does not take the final exam will fail the course.
There will be no makeup exams.</p>
<h1><span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> and JFLAP</h1>
<p>There are two tools that you will be using throughout this course,
<span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> and JFLAP.</p>
<p><span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> is a typesetting system which you will use to write up
solutions to the problem sets. Here is an <a href="example.pdf">example proof</a>
written in <span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span>. Here is the <a href="example.tex"><span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> source</a>.</p>
<p><span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> distributions are available for
OS&nbsp;X, *NIX, and Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html">TeX Live</a> (all systems)</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a> (Mac OS X; essentially TeX Live with some extras)</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://miktex.org/download">MiKTeX</a> (Windows)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of good references on the Web including</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">The
Not So Short Introduction to <span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> 2e</a> Good introduction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="ftp://ftp.ams.org/ams/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf">User's Guide for the
amsmath Package</a> Documentation for mathematical environments.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/">TeX StackExchange</a> Q&amp;A site.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://piazza.com/class/idlrvo78up6qq">Our Piazza Forum</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many tools that can assist in writing <span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span>, including a
variety of specialized editors such as
<a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">Texmaker</a> and
<a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/">TeXShop</a> as well as add ons
for editors like <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LaTeX">Emacs</a> (AUCTeX
is probably the best of them) and <a href="http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/">Vim</a>.</p>
<p>Writing your solutions in <span class="tex">L<span class="raise">a</span>T<span class="drop">e</span>X</span> will take time at first, but as you
become more familiar with it, you'll find that it's an invaluable
tool. I <i>strongly</i> recommend you learn to use it well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jflap.org">JFLAP</a> is software that you may use for building
some of the machines we will be discussing such as DFAs and Turing
machines. Nothing in the class requires you to use the software, but I
recommend it. It's a good way to test your solutions before turning
them in.</p>
<p>You can also using JFLAP as an easy way to produce diagrams for your
DFAs, NFAs, etc. that you can then save as PDF and include as graphics
in your problem sets (and exercises). There is a
<a href="http://www.jflap.org/tutorial/">tutorial</a> as well.</p>
