You are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to attend every class. Lectures are not recorded. If you are unable to attend class, you should consider asking a classmate to take notes for you.<h3 id=missed-or-late-work-policy>Missed or Late Work Policy</h3><p>Homework is due by the time specified on each homework page. After the due date has passed, you may turn in the assignment up to 24 hours late with a 25% penalty.<h3 id=electronic-communication-policy>Electronic Communication Policy</h3><p><strong>All electronic communication with course staff should take place on <a href=https://piazza.com/uic/spring2018/cs301/home>Piazza</a></strong> unless emails are specifically requested by the staff. Course staff may, from time to time, respond to emails, but a response to one email does not guarantee a response to a second. <strong>Use <a href=https://piazza.com/uic/spring2018/cs301/home>Piazza</a>!</strong><h3 id=collaboration-policy>Collaboration Policy</h3><p>You may collaborate with as many other students in the class on the homework.

All members of the campus community–students, staff, faculty, and administrators–share the responsibility of insuring that these standards are upheld so that such an environment exists. Instances of academic misconduct by students will be handled pursuant to the&nbsp;<a href=http://dos.uic.edu/docs/Student%20Disciplinary%20Policy.pdf>Student Disciplinary Policy</a>.<p>The following are examples of academic misconduct.<ul><li>Claiming someone else’s work as your own.<li>Searching for existing solutions to assignments.<li>Sharing solutions to quizzes or exams.<li>Falsifying program output.</ul></section><section><h2 id=religious-holidays>Religious Holidays</h2><p>The <a href=http://oae.uic.edu/religious-calendar/>UIC Senate Policy on religious holidays</a> is the following.<blockquote><p>The faculty of the University of Illinois at Chicago shall make every effort to avoid scheduling examinations or requiring that student projects be turned in or completed on religious holidays. Students who wish to observe their religious holidays shall notify the faculty member by the tenth day of the semester of the date when they will be absent unless the religious holiday is observed on or before the tenth day of the semester. In such cases, the students shall notify the faculty member at least five days in advance of the date when he/she will be absent. The faculty member shall make every reasonable effort to honor the request, not penalize the student for missing the class, and if an examination or project is due during the absence, give the student an exam or assignment equivalent to the one completed by those students in attendance. If the student feels aggrieved, he/she may request remedy through the campus grievance procedure.</blockquote></section><section><h2 id=academic-deadlines>Academic Deadlines</h2><p>See the <a href=https://grad.uic.edu/academic-calendar-0#Sp18>academic calendar</a>.</section><section><h2 id=grievance-procedures>Grievance Procedures</h2><p>UIC is committed to the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity, and human dignity involving students and employees.
