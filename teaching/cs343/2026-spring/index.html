It will cover a variety of topics with special emphasis on software vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and mitigation measures. It is designed as a projects-based course where you will get hands-on experience with the topics covered in the course.</section><section><h2 id=assessment>Assessment</h2><p>Your course grade will be determined by class participation, projects and two exams, equally weighted. There are no other assignments. See the <a href=schedule.html>schedule</a> for dates.<ul><li>10% Class participation<li>70% Projects<li>20% Exams</ul><h3 id=programming-projects>Programming Projects</h3><p>The programming projects are meant as a way to get hands-on experience with computer security concepts. You will find that there is quite a difference between conceptually understanding how to exploit a given vulnerability and actually producing a working exploit.<p>The programming projects are designed to be done in groups of 2. (Working alone is allowed, but discouraged.) Each project will have both programming and writing components. Both group members are expected to participate fully in both the programming and writing.<ul><li><a href=project1.html>Project 1</a>: Memory Safety<li><a href=project2.html>Project 2</a>: Return-oriented Programming<li>Project 3: Reverse Engineering<li><a href=project4.html>Project 4</a>: Crypto Fun</ul></section><section><h2 id=course-materials>Course Materials</h2><h3 id=required-texts>Required Texts</h3><p>There are no required textbooks.<h3 id=resources>Resources</h3><p>Here are some resources you may find helpful while working on the projects.<ul><li><em><a href=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html>Intel 64 and IA-32 Architecture Software Developer Manuals</a></em>. These manuals tell you everything you’ll want to know about how modern Intel x86 processors work. In particular, you’re probably going to want <em>Volumes 2A, 2B, and 2C: Instruction Set Reference</em>.<li><a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220829213750/http://ref.x86asm.net/geek.html>X86 Opcode and Instruction Reference</a>. This page gives a handy way to look up each x86 instruction by opcode.<li><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508091109/http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0406c/index.html">ARM Architecture Reference Manual ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R edition</a></em>. ARM manual for the processor we’ll be looking at. It requires registering to download (or a quick Google search).<li><a href=https://developer.arm.com/documentation/qrc0001/m/>ARM and Thumb-2 Instruction Set Quick Reference Card</a></ul></section><section><h2 id=course-policies>Course Policies</h2><h3 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites</h3><p>Students are expected to enter this course with a basic knowledge of systems programming, data structures. Some knowledge of C, C++, assembly, and compilers will be helpful, but the relevant information will be covered in the course or in provided references.<h3 id=attendance-policy>Attendance Policy</h3><p>Class attendance is not mandatory; however, research indicates that students who attend class are more likely to be successful. You are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to attend every class. Lectures are not recorded. If you are unable to attend class, you should consider asking a classmate to take notes for you.<h3 id=missed-or-late-work-policy>Missed or Late Work Policy</h3><p>Projects are due by 23:59 on the day specified on each project page. You have 3 late days that you can use throughout the semester. Each day that a project is late decreases the number of late days you <em>and</em> your partner have left. If you run out of late days, projects turned in late will receive a score of 0. There will be no exceptions to this policy without prior approval from Prof. Checkoway.<h3 id=collaboration-policy>Collaboration Policy</h3><p>You are allowed, and encouraged, to work in groups of size two on all projects. You are free to have different groups for different projects. You are not allowed to work with anyone outside your group. Doing so is academic misconduct.<h3 id=academic-integrity-policy>Academic Integrity Policy</h3><p>You must adhere to the Oberlin College <a href=https://www.oberlin.edu/dean-of-students/student-conduct/academic-integrity>Academic Integrity Policy</a>. Please familiarize yourself with the Honor Code.<h3 id=religious-holiday-observance-policy>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</h3><p>Students wishing to be excused from class in order to observe religious holidays must follow the Oberlin College <a href=https://www.oberlin.edu/religious-and-spiritual-life/resources/religious-holiday-observance-policy>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</a>.</section></main>
