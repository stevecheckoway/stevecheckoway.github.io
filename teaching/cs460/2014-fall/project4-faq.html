<h2 id="general">General Questions</h2>

<p><b>Is <code>magic_quotes_gpc</code> enabled on the Web
server?</b></p>

<blockquote>
No, it&rsquo;s not.  <code>magic_quotes_gpc</code> is deprecated.
Zoobar performs SQL sanitization on database-bound input
using <code>$db-&gt;quote()</code>, which is a wrapper around the
SQLite-specific sanitization function.  Note that this sanitization,
like <code>magic_quotes_gpc</code>, doesn&rsquo;t do anything to angle
brackets (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>). For that, you want
<code><a href="http://php.net/htmlspecialchars"
>htmlspecialchars</a></code>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>
  Is register_globals enabled on the web server?
</b></p>

<blockquote>
  No, it's off.
</blockquote>

<p><b>
  Why do I get an error when I try to visit 
  <code>login.php</code> with my web browser?
</b> </p>

<blockquote>Actually, <code>login.php</code> isn&rsquo;t intended to be
viewed directly. It&rsquo;s just a library of functions that get called if
the user tries to view one of the other pages and isn&rsquo;t logged in yet.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Is <code>http://zoobar.org/</code> different from
<code>http://www.zoobar.org/</code>? </b></p>

<blockquote>
  Yes.  <code>www.zoobar.org</code> may not work inside your BoxesX
  VM, and in any case is a separate domain
  from <code>zoobar.org</code> for purposes of the Same-Origin
  Policy.  Each domain will have its own cookies and they
  can&rsquo;t talk to each other.  You should
  use <code>zoobar.org</code> in your project.  (If
  one of your attacks isn&rsquo;t working, check to make sure you
  haven&rsquo;t added the &ldquo;www&rdquo; by mistake.)
</blockquote>

<p><b>Um &hellip; Same-Origin Policy? Do I need to know what that
is?</b></p>

<blockquote>
  You should be familiar with the Same-Origin Policy before
  attempting this project. The Same-Origin Policy is the most
  important idea behind Web application security; ignoring it will
  cause you to run into lots of browser security exceptions.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<p><b>Where can I find more information about JavaScript?</b></p>

<blockquote>
You can find a lot of references on <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+reference">Google</a>. 
There&rsquo;s a decent one at
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">W3Schools</a>.
Pay particular attention the DOM examples.
</blockquote>

<p><b>My JavaScript isn&rsquo;t working, and I don&rsquo;t know why. What can I do?</b></p>

<blockquote>
  Two extremely useful tools for debugging in Mozilla Firefox are the
  JavaScript console and the DOM Inspector. Both can be accessed from
  the Tools menu.  The JavaScript console lets you see which
  exceptions are being thrown and why.  The DOM Inspector lets you
  peek at the structure of the page and the properties and methods of
  each node it contains.  (If the DOM Inspector isn&rsquo;t installed,
  make sure it&rsquo;s selected when you install Mozilla Firefox.)
  You might also want to
  try <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/">Firebug</a>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What do I need to know about CSS?</b></p>

<blockquote>
You only need to know enough to make your attacks disappear.
You should know what <a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp">basic syntax</a> 
like <code>&lt;style&gt;.warning{display:none}&lt;/style&gt;</code>
means, and you should feel free to use stealthy attributes like
<code>style="<a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_class_display.asp">display</a>:
none; <a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_class_visibility.asp">visibility</a>:
hidden; <a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_dim_height.asp">height</a>: 0;
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_dim_width.asp">width</a>: 0;
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_class_position.asp">position</a>: absolute"</code> in the HTML of your attacks.
Beware that frames and images 
may behave strangely with 
<code>display: none</code>, so you might want to use
<code>visibility: hidden</code> instead.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How can I see cookies and form data that the browser sends?</b></p>

<blockquote>
  Try the
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-http-headers/">LiveHTTPHeaders</a>
  browser extension.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Where can I find more information about PHP?</b></p>

<blockquote>
  The definitive resource on PHP
  is <a href="http://php.net/">php.net</a>.  You can find some
  introductory tutorials there.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hints">Hints on the Attacks</h2>

<p><b>Am I allowed to load scripts or images from other domains?</b></p>

<blockquote>
  No, your attacks should not load data from domains other than
  <code>zoobar.org</code> and <code>zoomail.org</code>.  We are
  enforcing this policy so that the submission deadline is a hard one.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Are we allowed to include additional files?</b></p>

<blockquote>
  Please limit yourself to the files requested. One file per attack,
  the README file, and the ID file.
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h2 id="attacka">Attack A.</h2>

<p><b>How are the graders going to test our URL?</b></p>

<blockquote>We will put it into the browser&rsquo;s address bar and click the
"Go" button.</blockquote>

<p><b>The example attack doesn&rsquo;t seem to do anything. What&rsquo;s wrong?</b></p>

<blockquote>
You need to be logged in to <code>zoobar.org</code> before
the attack will work. When you click the link, you
should get a browser alert with the contents of
<code>document.cookie</code>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Why would someone want to steal <code>document.cookie</code>?</b></p>

<blockquote>
The cookie is the user&rsquo;s authentication credential. If you steal
someone else&rsquo;s cookie, it is easy to hijack that user&rsquo;s session
(although we won&rsquo;t ask you to do so in this project).  
</blockquote>

<p><b>How am I supposed to email <code>document.cookie</code>? I
didn&rsquo;t know browsers could send email.</b></p>

<blockquote>
You have to convince the browser to send a GET request to the
<code>http://zoomail.org/sendmail.php</code>email script,
which will cause an email to be sent by the
<code>zoomail.org</code> server inside the BoxesX
VM to the user account.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I convince the browser to send a GET request to an URL of
my choosing?</b></p>

<blockquote>
  The email script
  inside the BoxesX VM provides some example code.  You allocate a
  JavaScript Image object, and set its <code>src</code> attribute to
  be the URL you want the browser to retrieve. The browser immediately
  tries to fetch the content of this image, even though the URL
  isn&rsquo;t actually pointing at an image and the image hasn&rsquo;t
  been inserted into the page anywhere. Pretty sneaky.
  Alternatively, you may use an iframe.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How to I put code into a URL? I want to have newlines and stuff.</b></p>

<blockquote>
It helps if you 
<a href="http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/topics/urlencoding.htm">URL-encode it</a>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Should I include the <code>javascript:void</code> part in my
code?</b></p>

<blockquote>
If you do, your attack might still work, but it&rsquo;s not necessary if
you&rsquo;re already within a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. Just copy
the part starting with <code>(new Image()).src=...</code> 
</blockquote>

<p><b>What&rsquo;s up with this <code>random</code> query parameter?</b></p>

<blockquote>
If you try your attack more than once, the browser might think that it
already has the image in its cache, and so it wouldn&rsquo;t send a second
GET request. Adding a random number to the end of the URL ensures that
the browser will think the new URL is different, and won&rsquo;t use the
cache. The email script ignores this
parameter, so it&rsquo;s only useful for bypassing the cache.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Why are the characters reflected back different from the ones in
the URL?</b></p>

<blockquote>
Your query parameter is URL decoded by the server before being
reflected back at the user.
You&rsquo;ll need to made sure that your attack code is URL
encoded. For example, use <code>+</code> instead of 
space and <code>%2b</code>
instead of <code>+</code>.
Here is a <a
href="http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/topics/urlencoding.htm">URL
encoding reference</a> and a handy 
<span style="color: red">
conversion tool</span>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Are there any restrictions on the length of my solution URL?</b></p>

<blockquote>
No. Internet Explorer has a limit of 2083 characters or so for URLs,
but the limit is much longer in Firefox, which is what we are using for
grading. My solution was under 350
characters, and shorter solutions are possible.</blockquote>

<p><b>Since a sending an email is a side effect of the request, 
wouldn&rsquo;t it
make more sense for the browser&rsquo;s request to be a POST instead of a
GET?</b></p>

<blockquote>
Yes, but that would prevent the Image trick from working. 
Real-world attackers are rarely bothered by such semantic distinctions.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What should the email look like if the attack worked?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The parts that might be different are italicized.</p>

<pre class=email>
Payload:

ZoobarLogin=<em>YToyOntpOjA7czo4OiJhbnRpZ3JhdiI7aToxO3M6MzI6
ImZlOGIzMTM3YjgyNTFlMDQ2YTIzMzRkNTgxOWM2YWZiIjt9=</em>
</pre>

</blockquote>

<p><b>My attack is working. What should I do to make it invisible to
the user?</b></p>

<blockquote>
The text box should its usual size and in the normal place.
No warning text or characters that are normally part
of the page should be visible. From the point of view of the visitor,
it should appear as if they just went to <code>users.php</code> and
didn&rsquo;t put in a username yet (with the possible exception of the
address bar, which can be whatever you want). 
It&rsquo;s ok if the page briefly looks weird 
before correcting itself. Don&rsquo;t worry about the fact that
the header at the top of the page
changes with each page view &mdash; that&rsquo;s normal site
behavior.
</blockquote>

<p><b>That sounds hard.</b></p>

<blockquote>There are actually several 
quick and easy ways to do it, so try to think outside the box on this
one. If you can&rsquo;t figure it out, 
try moving on to the other attacks and come back to this one when
you&rsquo;re done.
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h2 id="attackb">Attack B.</h2>

<p><b>Is this a cross site scripting attack?</b></p>

<blockquote>
No, this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSRF">cross site request forgery</a>
attack. 
You are exploiting the fact that <code>zoobar.org</code> uses only a cookie to
authenticate requests, even ones with side effects.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Can I use the vulnerability in <code>user.php</code> from Attack A?</b></p>

<blockquote>
No. Since this not a cross site scripting attack, you do not need to use the 
vulnerability in <code>user.php</code>.
All you have to do convince the user&rsquo;s
browser to post malicious form data to <code>transfer.php</code>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I convince the browser to send a malicious
POST request to <code>transfer.php</code>?</b></p>

<blockquote>
Put together a form in your
HTML document, with 
<code>http://zoobar.org/transfer.php</code> as the
<code>action</code> attribute.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How can I get the form to be submitted with no user interaction?</b></p>

<blockquote>
You can call the "Send" button&rsquo;s <code>click</code> method. 
Or, you can use JavaScript to call the form&rsquo;s <code>submit</code> method.
Keep in mind that the site is looking for a parameter named
"submission" in the form data, so if it&rsquo;s not there, the transfer
won&rsquo;t happen.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> fields should the form contain?</b></p>

<blockquote>
Use the browser&rsquo;s view source function
on <code>transfer.php</code> and you&rsquo;ll get a pretty good
idea.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How can I submit a form to <code>zoobar.org</code> without
causing the browser&rsquo;s address bar to change to
<code>zoobar.org</code>?</b></p>

<blockquote>
Create a hidden <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> 
and make sure the form&rsquo;s <code>target</code>
attribute matches the frame&rsquo;s <code>name</code> attribute.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Uh oh, iframes. Will the grader have third-party cookie blocking
enabled?</b></p>

<blockquote>
No, third party cookie blocking will not be enabled.  It&rsquo;s
probably off by default on your browser, but if your attack
isn&rsquo;t working because the login cookie isn&rsquo;t sent, you
might want to check to make sure.  Tools &rarr; Options &rarr; Privacy
&rarr; Cookies &rarr; Uncheck &ldquo;for the originating site
only.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I make the iframe hidden?</b></p>

<blockquote>
There are lots of ways to do it, but the easiest is probably
<code>&lt;iframe style="visibility: hidden" ...&gt;</code>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I redirect the browser to the CS 460 home page?</b></p>

<blockquote>Change the <code>document.location</code> 
property. Note that it is okay (and required, in fact) 
for the browser&rsquo;s
address bar to change to
<code>https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~s/teaching/cs460/2013-fall/</code> once your
attack is complete.</blockquote>

<p><b>How do ensure that the redirect doesn&rsquo;t happen until after 
the form data has been posted?</b></p>

<blockquote>You can trigger the redirect from the frame&rsquo;s 
<code>onload</code> handler. Depending on how your code is written,
this <code>onload</code> handler may get called twice &mdash; once
when the page initially loads and once when the form is
submitted. If this is the case, you&rsquo;ll have to 
make sure that you change <code>document.location</code> 
on the second time only.
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h2 id="attackc">Attack C.</h2>

<p><b>Does PHP's SQLite driver support multiple SQL statements in a single
    query, separated by a semicolon?</b></p>

<blockquote>
  No, it doesn't appear to.  Your solution will somehow have to work
  without relying on injecting extra statements after those performed
  by the Zoobar site.
</blockquote>


<hr/>

<h2 id="attackd">Attack D</h2>

<p><b>Is this a phishing attack?</b></p>

<blockquote>
No.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What can we assume the grader will do when logging in?</b></p>

<blockquote>
The grader will type a username, then click the password field, type a
password, then move the mouse over the login button and click it.
The grader will then wait for the login to complete.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Why is the site using JavaScript to focus the username field?</b></p>

<blockquote>It&rsquo;s a convenience for the visitor, so they don&rsquo;t have to
select the username field manually when they first come to the page.
You may it useful as well.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I get the browser to call my injected code?</b></p>

<blockquote>Because your code is sanitized with
<code>htmlspecialchars</code>, you won&rsquo;t be able to inject a simple
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag like you did in Attack A. 
Trick the browser into running your code another way.
</blockquote>

<p><b>I think I figured it out, but when I call <code>alert</code>
to test my attack, nothing happens.</b></p>

<blockquote>
It turns out that calling <code>alert</code> would lead to an infinite
loop of dialog boxes, 
so Firefox is trying to be helpful by preventing it. Try using
something like <code>document.loginform.login_username.value=42</code> 
to test whether your attack is working.

<p>(Note, it's not clear to me what this question is about. I didn't run
into any infinite loops with alert, but I'm leaving it here in case
anyone runs into this. &ndash; sc)
</blockquote>

<p><b>How am I supposed to invoke the email
script from my script without using any characters that will get escaped?</b></p>

<blockquote>
There are numerous static methods of <code><a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp">String</a></code>
that you might find usable.
Also, don&rsquo;t forget about
<code><a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_escape.asp">escape</a></code>, 
<code><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_unescape.asp">unescape</a></code>, and
<code><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp">eval</a></code>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Encoding by hand is incredibly tedious. Help?</b></p>

<blockquote>You can save yourself some headaches if you write out your
attack as a string in your attack page and then encode it
programmatically, using those static <code><a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp"
>String</a></code> methods.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What do I need to do to make my attack invisible to the user?</b></p>

<blockquote>You&rsquo;ll have to get a handle on the relevant DOM nodes and make
the extraneous text disappear, either by deleting the text or setting
the <code>style.display</code> property to <code>"none"</code>.</blockquote>

<p><b>How can I get a handle on the warning message? It doesn&rsquo;t have an
<code>id</code> attribute.</b></p>

<blockquote>It does have other distinguishing characteristics.
You may find 
<a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_document.asp">getElementsByTagName</a>
useful.
Depending on how your attack works, you may not see a warning message
anyway.</blockquote>

<p><b>I&rsquo;m sending the email when the form is submitted, but it isn&rsquo;t
working. What&rsquo;s wrong?</b></p>

<blockquote>
There&rsquo;s a race condition here where the form may be
getting submitted
before the email image is downloaded. Once the form submit starts, the
thread that&rsquo;s downloading the image is killed. So, to ensure that your
attack always works, you should delay
the form submission a little bit. You can use 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener"><code>addEventListener</code></a> with an event handler such as
<code>function(evt) { evt.preventDefault(); ... }</code>. 
In this way, you can prevent the form submission until you&rsquo;re ready to
trigger it yourself.

<p>You can also use an <code>onsubmit</code> handler that returns false.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Ok, I prevented the submission. How long should I wait?</b></p>

<blockquote>
If you&rsquo;re lazy, you can use <code>setTimeout</code> with a
reasonable number of milliseconds. But the precise way of doing it is
to use <code>addEventListener</code>
to wait for the "error" event to fire on the Image object you created.
That event indicates that the email script&rsquo;s server has started to 
respond with a non-image file, meaning that it successfully
processed the email send request.

<p>You can also use an iframe's <code>onload</code> handler.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What should I do after the email is sent?</b></p>

<blockquote>You can
trigger the submission manually using the login button&rsquo;s
<code>click()</code> method. 
Use <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener"><code>removeEventListener()</code></a>
to avoid infinite loops.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Is it okay if the attack doesn&rsquo;t work when the HTML file is
clicked on the desktop, but it does work when the URL of the HTML file
is put into the browser address bar directly?</b></p>

<blockquote>
That is fine. We will test your attack by putting in the URL of your
HTML file in the browser&rsquo;s address bar.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What should the email look like if the attack worked?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The parts that might be different are italicized.</p>

<pre class=email>
Payload:

<em>grader</em>,<em>topsecret</em>
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Firefox keeps asking if I want to save the password. Is there
any way I can turn this off?</b></p>

<blockquote>You can probably turn it off by setting
<code>autocomplete="no"</code> in each of your form fields, but it
shouldn&rsquo;t present much of an issue for grading. The grader will have
already hit "Never for this site" before testing your attack, so the
dialog won&rsquo;t come up.</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h2 id="attacke">Attack E.</h2>

<p><b>How does the site sanitize profiles?</b></p>

<blockquote>
It uses <a
href="http://php.net/striptags"><code>strip_tags()</code></a> 
to restrict the tags that can be used,
and it uses a regular expression to replace certain dangerous words like
"onmouseover" with a space character. Note that
<code>strip_tags()</code> will remove all tags that are more than 1024
characters. If your solution occurs inside a tag, you will have to
make sure it fits inside this limit, or it won&rsquo;t render to the user.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What tags does zoobar.org allow in profiles?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<code>
&lt;a&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;img&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;th&gt;
&lt;u&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;span&gt; 
</code></blockquote>

<p><b>What strings does zoobar.org not allow in profiles?</b></p>

<blockquote>
<code>
javascript: eval setTimeout setInterval window target
      onAbort onBlur onChange onClick onDblClick 
      onDragDrop onError onFocus onKeyDown onKeyPress 
      onKeyUp onLoad onMouseDown onMouseMove onMouseOut 
      onMouseOver onMouseUp onMove onReset onResize 
      onSelect onSubmit onUnload
</code>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Keep in mind that this is an example of what <b>not</b> to do.
Blacklisting keywords is a recipe for disaster and will annoy,
but not limit, a determined attacker.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I transfer the zoobar?</b></p>

<blockquote>
Create an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> pointing to 
<code>transfer.php</code>,
set the appropriate form fields inside it, and post the form.
Alternatively, you can create a form on the current page
with <code>transfer.php</code> as its target, and
then post it with the <code>target</code> pointing at an 
<code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. Another option is to use
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a>,
since you&rsquo;re actually making a same-site request this time.
Pick whichever approach you prefer.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I create an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>?</b></p>

<blockquote>
You can use the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/level-one-core.html#i-Document">DOM
methods</a> <code>document.createElement</code> and
<code>document.body.appendChild</code>.
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I get a handle on form fields inside the
<code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>?</b></p>

<blockquote>It differs by browser, and only works when the frame&rsquo;s
domain matches the parent page (that&rsquo;s the Same Origin Policy). 
Here&rsquo;s the Firefox way of doing it:
<code>iframe.contentDocument.forms[0].zoobars.value = 1;</code>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Are there any alternatives to <code>target</code>, which is blacklisted?</b></p>

<blockquote>
You can use string concatenation to express "target" without actually 
saying it. The following are equivalent in JavaScript: x.target,
x["target"], x["tar"+"get"]. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I replace the profile?</b></p>

<blockquote>
Use the same technique you just used on <code>transfer.php</code>,
but point at <code>index.php</code> instead.</blockquote>

<p><b>Is there an easy way to get a copy of the current profile?</b></p>

<blockquote>
You can use <code>document.getElementById('profile').innerHTML</code>, 
but it may mangle quotes in your profile, so be sure
to check that the replicated profile is still functional. Also, note
that only <code>display:inline</code> tags can be nested inside a 
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.
