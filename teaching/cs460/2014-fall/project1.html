<p><b>Due:</b> Tuesday, September 30 at 23:59.<br /></p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with the effect of
buffer overflows and other memory-safety bugs.</p>
<p>All work in this project must be done in the QEMU virtual machine
provided on the course website; see below for information about this
environment.</p>
<p>You are given, in the <tt>targets</tt> directory, the source code for five
exploitable programs, <tt>target1</tt>, &hellip;, <tt>target5</tt>.
These programs are to be compiled and installed, setuid root, in the
<tt>/tmp</tt> directory of your VM. Your goal is to write five exploit programs
<tt>sploit1</tt>, &hellip;, <tt>sploit5</tt>, each of which will execute the
corresponding target with input that exploits that target's bug,
giving a root shell on the VM.</p>
<p>We have provided skeletons for these exploits programs in the
<tt>sploits</tt> directory, as <tt>sploit1.c</tt>, &hellip;, <tt>sploit5.c</tt>. Our own
solutions, incidentally, are very short: fewer than 50 lines each. So
while understanding and exploiting the bugs will not be easy, you will
not need to write a lot of code.</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>You may work on this project in collaboration with a single partner as
described on the <a href="index.html">main page</a>.</p>
<p>You must not discuss the project with anyone other than your partner
and course staff. You may use online resources for general reference,
but not to search for solutions to specific questions posed in this
project.</p>
<h2>The Environment</h2>
<p>You (and we, for grading) will test your exploit programs within a
QEMU ARM virtual machine. This virtual machine emulates an ARM
processor.</p>
<p>There are two options for running this virtual machine.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can install <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page">QEMU</a> on your computer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can run QEMU from inside the sandbox virtual machine from
<a href="project0.html">project&nbsp;0</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, you will need to download and decompress
qemu-arm.tar.bz2. The ARM VM can be started by
running the <tt>start-arm.sh</tt> inside the <tt>qemu-arm</tt> directory. You can
log in to the user account using the username/password
armuser/armuser. In addition to giving you &ldquo;console&rdquo; access to the
emulated ARM machine, the start-arm.sh script forwards local port 2200
to port 22 (the ssh port) in the VM. Thus, from a Linux or OS&nbsp;X
machine, you can ssh to the ARM VM using</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<div class="blockcontent"><pre>
$ ssh -larmuser -p 2200 localhost
</pre></div></div>
<p>You can put the following lines in your local machine's
<tt>$HOME/.ssh/config</tt> to provide easy ssh access:</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<div class="blockcontent"><pre>
Host = armguest
HostName = localhost
Port = 2200
User = armuser
</pre></div></div>
<p>You can then use the following to log in.</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<div class="blockcontent"><pre>
$ ssh armguest
</pre></div></div>
<p>If you are running the QEMU VM inside the VirtualBox VM, then the
following line in your <tt>$HOME/.ssh/config</tt> works.</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<div class="blockcontent"><pre>
Host = sandbox
HostName = localhost
Port = 2222
User = user

Host = armguest
ProxyCommand = ssh -q sandbox localhost 2200
</pre></div></div>
<p>The VM has Ubuntu installed as well as a number of useful
utilities such as vim, ssh, and wget, and several hex editors such as
<tt>dhex</tt>.</p>
<p>Once you have the QEMU VM installed, launch it, log in, and download
and decompress the assignment tarball.</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<div class="blockcontent"><pre>
$ wget https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~s/teaching/cs460/2014-fall/project1.tar.gz
$ tar zxf project1.tar.gz
</pre></div></div>
<h2>The Targets</h2>
<p>The <tt>targets</tt> directory in the assignment tarball contains the source
code for the targets along with a <tt>Makefile</tt> specifying how they are
to be built. To compile the targets and install them setuid root in
<tt>/tmp</tt>, use the commands <tt>make</tt> and <tt>make install</tt>.</p>
<p><tt>target5</tt> is fairly complicated. It reads commands for manipulating
strings from the file specified as its argument. Due to the way
<tt>target5</tt> is compiled, the glibc <tt>malloc</tt>/<tt>free</tt>/<tt>realloc</tt> functions are not
used. Instead, the replacement functions in <tt>smalloc.c</tt> are called. It is
easiest to set a breakpoint in <tt>smalloc</tt>/<tt>sfree</tt>/<tt>srealloc</tt> rather than
trying to step into calls to <tt>malloc</tt>.</p>
<h2>The Exploits</h2>
<p>The <tt>sploits</tt> directory in the assignment tarball contains skeleton
source for the exploits which you are to write, along with a
<tt>Makefile</tt> for building them. Also included is <tt>shellcode.h</tt>, which
contains shellcode for you to use.</p>
<p>Your exploits should assume that the compiled target programs are
installed in <tt>/tmp</tt>&#8201;&mdash;&#8201;<tt>/tmp/target1</tt>, &hellip;, <tt>/tmp/target5</tt>.</p>
<p>Along with each exploit skeleton file, there is an empty text file
that you should fill with an explanation of the bug in the
corresponding target and how your exploit takes advantage of it. You
will submit this explanation along with your exploit.</p>
<h2>The Assignment</h2>
<p>You are to write exploits, one per target. Each exploit, when run in
the virtual machine with its target installed setuid-root in <tt>/tmp</tt>,
should yield a root shell (<tt>/bin/sh</tt>).</p>
<h2>Hints</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Read Aleph One's &ldquo;Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit,&rdquo; carefully!
Also, read the &ldquo;suggested reading&rdquo; listed in the project <tt>README</tt>.
You will want to have a good understanding of what happens to the
stack, program counter, and relevant registers before and after a
function call. Read scut's &ldquo;Exploiting Format String
Vulnerabilities.&rdquo; It will be helpful to have a solid understanding
of the basic buffer overflow exploits before reading the more
advanced exploit papers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <tt>gdb</tt> debugger is your best friend in this assignment as you'll
want to understand what's going on in the target program's memory
space. Specifically, note the <tt>disassemble</tt> and <tt>stepi</tt> commands.
You may find the <tt>x</tt> command useful to examine memory (and the
different ways you can print the contents such as <tt>/a</tt> or <tt>/i</tt>
after <tt>x</tt>). The <tt>info register</tt> command is helpful for printing out
the contents of registers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A useful way to run <tt>gdb</tt> is to use the <tt>-e</tt> and <tt>-s</tt> command line
flags; for example, the command
<tt>gdb -e ./sploit3 -s /tmp/target3</tt> 
tells <tt>gdb</tt> to execute <tt>sploit3</tt> and use the symbols from <tt>target3</tt>
which allows you to trace execution in the target in exactly the way
it is executed by the exploit. By contrast, executing just
<tt>gdb /tmp/target3</tt> will trace the target in the way it is executed
by the shell, so the memory layout will be different. (Avoiding a
segfault while using this requires careful timing in setting
breakpoints. See the assignment <tt>README</tt> for the details.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>One of the projects is very constrained in what arguments can be
passed to it and you may have trouble running code on the heap
(i.e., memory allocated by <tt>malloc</tt>). Try placing the shellcode
somewhere else.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that your exploits work within the provided virtual
machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start early! Theoretical knowledge of exploits does not readily
translate into the ability to write working exploits. The first
target is relatively simple to exploit, but the difficulty ramps up
from there.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Warnings</h2>
<p>Aleph One gives code that calculates addresses on the target's stack
based on addresses on the exploit's stack. Addresses on the exploit's
stack can be changed based on how the exploit is executed (working
directory, arguments, environment, etc.); in our testing, we do not
guarantee to execute your exploits the same way <tt>bash</tt> does.</p>
<p>You must, therefore, hard-code target stack locations in your
exploits. You should <i>not</i> use a function such as <tt>get_sp</tt> in the
exploits you hand in.</p>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>You will need to submit the source code for your exploits, along
with any files (Makefile, shellcode.h) necessary for building them.
Make sure that all of your exploits compile with a single <tt>make</tt>
command!</p>
</li>
<li><p>In addition, along with each exploit, you should include a text
file (sploit1.txt, sploit2.txt, and so on).  In this text file,
explain how your exploit works: what the bug is in the corresponding
target, how you exploit it, and where the various constants in your
exploit come from.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, you must include a file called <tt>ID</tt> which contains the names
of all partners (or just your own if you worked by yourself).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Create a single tarball containing your sploits directory and turn
that in on blackboard. The easiest way to do that is</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<div class="blockcontent"><pre>
$ cd project1/sploits
$ make clean
$ cd ..
$ tar zcf sploits.tar.gz sploits
</pre></div></div>
