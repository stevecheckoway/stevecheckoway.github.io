These programs are to be compiled and installed, setuid root, in the <code>/tmp</code> directory of your VM. Your goal is to write five exploit programs <code>sploit1</code>, …, <code>sploit5</code>, each of which will execute the corresponding target with input that exploits that target's bug, giving a root shell on the VM.<p>We have provided skeletons for these exploits programs in the <code>sploits</code> directory, as <code>sploit1.c</code>, …, <code>sploit5.c</code>. Our own solutions, incidentally, are very short: fewer than 50 lines each. So while understanding and exploiting the bugs will not be easy, you will not need to write a lot of code.<h2>Collaboration</h2><p>You may work on this project in collaboration with a single partner as described on the <a href=index.html>main page</a>.<p>You must not discuss the project with anyone other than your partner and course staff. You may use online resources for general reference, but not to search for solutions to specific questions posed in this project.<h2>The Environment</h2><p>You (and we, for grading) will test your exploit programs within a QEMU ARM virtual machine. This virtual machine emulates an ARM processor.<p>There are two options for running this virtual machine.<ol><li><p>You can install <a href=https://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page>QEMU</a> on your computer.<li><p>You can run QEMU from inside the sandbox virtual machine from <a href=project0.html>project&nbsp;0</a>.</ol><p>In either case, you will need to download and decompress qemu-arm.tar.bz2. The ARM VM can be started by running the <code>start-arm.sh</code> inside the <code>qemu-arm</code> directory. You can log in to the user account using the username/password armuser/armuser. In addition to giving you “console” access to the emulated ARM machine, the start-arm.sh script forwards local port 2200 to port 22 (the ssh port) in the VM. Thus, from a Linux or OS&nbsp;X machine, you can ssh to the ARM VM using<div class=codeblock><div class=blockcontent><pre>$ ssh -larmuser -p 2200 localhost
</pre></div></div><p>You can put the following lines in your local machine's <code>$HOME/.ssh/config</code> to provide easy ssh access:<div class=codeblock><div class=blockcontent><pre>Host = armguest
HostName = localhost
Port = 2200
User = armuser
</pre></div></div><p>You can then use the following to log in.<div class=codeblock><div class=blockcontent><pre>$ ssh armguest
</pre></div></div><p>If you are running the QEMU VM inside the VirtualBox VM, then the following line in your <code>$HOME/.ssh/config</code> works.<div class=codeblock><div class=blockcontent><pre>Host = sandbox
HostName = localhost
Port = 2222
User = user

Host = armguest
ProxyCommand = ssh -q sandbox localhost 2200
</pre></div></div><p>The VM has Ubuntu installed as well as a number of useful utilities such as vim, ssh, and wget, and several hex editors such as <code>dhex</code>.<p>Once you have the QEMU VM installed, launch it, log in, and download and decompress the assignment tarball.<div class=codeblock><div class=blockcontent><pre>$ wget https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~s/teaching/cs460/2014-fall/project1.tar.gz
$ tar zxf project1.tar.gz
</pre></div></div><h2>The Targets</h2><p>The <code>targets</code> directory in the assignment tarball contains the source code for the targets along with a <code>Makefile</code> specifying how they are to be built. To compile the targets and install them setuid root in <code>/tmp</code>, use the commands <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code>.<p><code>target5</code> is fairly complicated. It reads commands for manipulating strings from the file specified as its argument. Due to the way <code>target5</code> is compiled, the glibc <code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code>/<code>realloc</code> functions are not used. Instead, the replacement functions in <code>smalloc.c</code> are called. It is easiest to set a breakpoint in <code>smalloc</code>/<code>sfree</code>/<code>srealloc</code> rather than trying to step into calls to <code>malloc</code>.<h2>The Exploits</h2><p>The <code>sploits</code> directory in the assignment tarball contains skeleton source for the exploits which you are to write, along with a <code>Makefile</code> for building them. Also included is <code>shellcode.h</code>, which contains shellcode for you to use.<p>Your exploits should assume that the compiled target programs are installed in <code>/tmp</code> — <code>/tmp/target1</code>, …, <code>/tmp/target5</code>.<p>Along with each exploit skeleton file, there is an empty text file that you should fill with an explanation of the bug in the corresponding target and how your exploit takes advantage of it. You will submit this explanation along with your exploit.<h2>The Assignment</h2><p>You are to write exploits, one per target. Each exploit, when run in the virtual machine with its target installed setuid-root in <code>/tmp</code>, should yield a root shell (<code>/bin/sh</code>).<h2>Hints</h2><ol><li><p>Read Aleph One's “Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit,” carefully! Also, read the “suggested reading” listed in the project <code>README</code>. You will want to have a good understanding of what happens to the stack, program counter, and relevant registers before and after a function call. Read scut's “Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities.” It will be helpful to have a solid understanding of the basic buffer overflow exploits before reading the more advanced exploit papers.<li><p>The <code>gdb</code> debugger is your best friend in this assignment as you'll want to understand what's going on in the target program's memory space. Specifically, note the <code>disassemble</code> and <code>stepi</code> commands. You may find the <code>x</code> command useful to examine memory (and the different ways you can print the contents such as <code>/a</code> or <code>/i</code> after <code>x</code>). The <code>info register</code> command is helpful for printing out the contents of registers.<li><p>A useful way to run <code>gdb</code> is to use the <code>-e</code> and <code>-s</code> command line flags; for example, the command <code>gdb -e ./sploit3 -s /tmp/target3</code> tells <code>gdb</code> to execute <code>sploit3</code> and use the symbols from <code>target3</code> which allows you to trace execution in the target in exactly the way it is executed by the exploit. By contrast, executing just <code>gdb /tmp/target3</code> will trace the target in the way it is executed by the shell, so the memory layout will be different. (Avoiding a segfault while using this requires careful timing in setting breakpoints. See the assignment <code>README</code> for the details.)<li><p>One of the projects is very constrained in what arguments can be passed to it and you may have trouble running code on the heap (i.e., memory allocated by <code>malloc</code>). Try placing the shellcode somewhere else.<li><p>Make sure that your exploits work within the provided virtual machine.<li><p>Start early! Theoretical knowledge of exploits does not readily translate into the ability to write working exploits. The first target is relatively simple to exploit, but the difficulty ramps up from there.</ol><h2>Warnings</h2><p>Aleph One gives code that calculates addresses on the target's stack based on addresses on the exploit's stack. Addresses on the exploit's stack can be changed based on how the exploit is executed (working directory, arguments, environment, etc.); in our testing, we do not guarantee to execute your exploits the same way <code>bash</code> does.<p>You must, therefore, hard-code target stack locations in your exploits. You should <i>not</i> use a function such as <code>get_sp</code> in the exploits you hand in.<h2>Deliverables</h2><ol><li><p>You will need to submit the source code for your exploits, along with any files (Makefile, shellcode.h) necessary for building them. Make sure that all of your exploits compile with a single <code>make</code> command!<li><p>In addition, along with each exploit, you should include a text file (sploit1.txt, sploit2.txt, and so on). In this text file, explain how your exploit works: what the bug is in the corresponding target, how you exploit it, and where the various constants in your exploit come from.<li><p>Finally, you must include a file called <code>ID</code> which contains the names of all partners (or just your own if you worked by yourself).</ol><p>Create a single tarball containing your sploits directory and turn that in on blackboard. The easiest way to do that is<div class=codeblock><div class=blockcontent><pre>$ cd project1/sploits
$ make clean
$ cd ..
$ tar zcf sploits.tar.gz sploits
