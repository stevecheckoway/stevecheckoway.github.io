<p>This course will cover software vulnerabilities, exploitation
techniques, and mitigation measures. It is designed as a
projects-based course where you will get hands-on experience finding
vulnerabilities and writing exploits.</p>
<h1>Announcements</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Oct. 30. There is no class Nov.&nbsp;4 and Nov.&nbsp;6. Work on <a href="project3.html">project&nbsp;3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sep. 22. There is an extension to Project 0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sep. 7. There is no class on Sep.&nbsp;9 and Sep.&nbsp;11. Work on
<a href="project1.html">project&nbsp;1</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Aug. 25. There is reading for the first day of class! See the
<a href="syllabus.html">Syllabus and Readings</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Students are expected to enter this course with a basic knowledge of
operating systems, data structures, and programming in C and (very
basic) C++. Some knowledge of assembly and compilers will be
helpful, but the relevant information will be covered in the course or
in provided references.</p>
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>Your course grade will be determined entirely projects. See below.
There are no exams.</p>
<p>Projects are due by 23:59 on the day specified on each project page.
You have 3 late days that you can use throughout the semester. Each
day that a project is late decreases the number of late days you <i>and</i>
your partner have left. If you run out of late days, projects turned
in late will receive a score of&nbsp;0. There will be no exceptions to this
policy without prior approval from Prof.&nbsp;Checkoway.</p>
<h1>Programming Projects</h1>
<p>The programming projects are meant as a way to get hands-on experience
exploiting software vulnerabilities. You will find that there is quite
a difference between conceptually understanding how to exploit a given
vulnerability and actually producing a working exploit.</p>
<p>The programming projects are designed to be done in groups of 2.
(Working alone is allowed, but discouraged.) Each project will have
both programming and writing components. Both group members are
expected to participate fully in both the programming and writing.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to work with different people on each project, but
group forming is completely up to you. If you're having trouble
finding a group, I suggest you use the
<a href="https://piazza.com/jhu/fall2014/en600460/home">Piazza forum</a> to find
one.</p>

<h1>Resources</h1>
<p>Here are some resources you may find helpful while working on the projects.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><i><a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architecture Software Developer Manuals</a></i>. These
manuals tell you everything you'll want to know about how modern
Intel x86 processors work. In particular, you're probably going to
want <i>Volumes 2A, 2B, and 2C: Instruction Set Reference</i>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/geek.html">X86 Opcode and Instruction
Reference</a>. This page gives a handy way to look up each x86
instruction by opcode.</p>

ARM manual for the processor we'll be looking at. It requires
registering to download (or a quick Google search).</p>

<h1>Computer Science Department Academic Integrity</h1>
<p><i>The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In your studies, you must be honest and truthful. Ethical
violations include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of
assignments, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices,
unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery
and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair
competition.</i></p>
<p><i>Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded.
Except where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all
homework and programming assignments without the help of others. For
example, you must not look at any other solutions (including program
code) to your homework problems or similar problems. However, you may
discuss assignment specifications with others to be sure you
understand what is required by the assignment.</i></p>
<p><i><b>If</b> your instructor permits using fragments of source code from
outside sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must
properly cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism.
Similarly, your group projects must list everyone who participated.</i></p>
<p><i>Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.</i></p>
<p><i>Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for
particular assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if
you are not sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the
instructor or TA, as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from
other students. (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may have
received.</i></p>
<p><i>Students who cheat will suffer a serious course grade penalty in
addition to being reported to university officials. You must abide by
JHU's Ethics Code: Report any violations you witness to the
instructor. You may consult the associate dean of students and/or the
chairman of the Ethics Board beforehand. For more information, see the
<a href="http://eng.jhu.edu/wse/asen_undergraduate_handbook/ugrad-ethics-board">Undergraduate Academic Ethics Board website</a> and the
<a href="http://engineering.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Grad-Student-Misconduct-Policy.pdf">Procedures for Handling Allegations of Misconduct by Full-time &amp;
Part-time Graduate Students</a>.</i></p>
<h1>Students with Disabilities</h1>
<p>Any student with a disability who may need accommodations in this
class must obtain an accommodation letter from Student Disability
Services, 385&nbsp;Garland, (410)&nbsp;516-4720,
<a href="mailto:studentdisabilityservices@jhu.edu">studentdisabilityservices@jhu.edu</a>.</p>
