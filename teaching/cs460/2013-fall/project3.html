<h2>How to set up the environment</h2>
For this project, as in previous projects, you are going to use 
a VirtualBox virtual machine.

<p>
<strong>Setting up Boxes on your own machine:</strong>
Download the BoxesX virtual machine image,
BoxesX.ova (warning: 600 MB!).  Note
that this is not the same VM image as the one in previous projects, so
you should not use those VMs.  The ova file should load into
VirtualBox.  Once the BoxesX VM is running, you will want to start X
and run the Iceweasel browser, <a href="#iceweasel">as described
below</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="iceweasel">How to run iceweasel</h2>

<p>
  The Web server serving the Zoobar site you will be attacking is
  hosted inside the VM.  (If you try to connect to zoobar.org outside
  the VM, you will get Stanford&rsquo;s site, which you
  should <strong>not</strong> try to interact with.)  Furthermore, the
  Web browser you&rsquo;ll use to develop and test your attacks is also
  hosted inside the VM.  It is called Iceweasel.
</p>
<p>
  Iceweasel is the Debian version of Firefox&mdash;essentially the
  same browser, but with a different name because of licensing issues.
  To start iceweasel in BoxesX, log in as user, and do the
  following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type the <code>startx</code> command.  This will start the X
    Windowing System, and a new window will be displayed with a
    xterm (shell) where you can enter commands.  (Click the mouse
    to place the window.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>iceweasel &amp;</code> within the newly displayed xterm.
    This will open the Iceweasel browser.  (Again, click the mouse
    to place the window.)
  </li>
  <li>
    In the URL bar, you can type <code>http://zoobar.org/</code> to
    connect to the Zoobar site.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Setting up port forwarding</h2>

<p>
  The easiest way to access your VM from the host computer is with
  SSH.  VirtualBox&rsquo;s networking rules do not by default allow
  incoming connections to the VM, but you can set up a port forwarding
  rule, as follows.  In the settings window for the BoxesX VM, choose
  the &ldquo;Network&rdquo; tab, then show the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo;
  options, and click the &ldquo;Port Forwarding&rdquo; button to bring
  up the port forwarding rules dialog.
<p>

<p>
  In this dialog, you should see a rule binding port 8024 of localhost
  (127.0.0.1) on the host to port 22 on the VM.  If this rule is not
  present, or if you would like to use a different port on the host,
  you can change the configuration and click OK.
</p>

<p>
  With port forwarding enabled, you can SSH into your VM using a
  command like &ldquo;<code>ssh user@localhost -p 8024</code>&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
  Note that if you also used port forwarding on port 8024 for project 2, SSH
  will get very upset, because the new VM&rsquo;s key is different and
  SSH suspects a man-in-the-middle attack.  It will tell you what line
  in <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> is responsible, and you can
  delete this line and try again.
</p>

<h2 id="backups">Backing up your work</h2>

<p>
  As with any project, you will want to make and keep frequent backups
  of your work.  If you are developing your code in
  <code>user</code>&rsquo; home directory inside the VM, then an easy
  way to back this directory up is with the <code>rsync</code>
  command.
<p>
<p>
  Suppose you have set up port forwarding so that port 8024 on the
  host forwards to port 22 on the VM.  And suppose you&rsquo;d like to
  back up into a directory called <code>bkp123</code> in your home
  directory.  Run the following command on the host:
  <blockquote>
    <code>rsync -av -e "ssh -p 8024" user@localhost:/home/user/ ~/bkp123/</code>
  </blockquote>
<p>
  If you run this command again later it will update the contents
  of <code>bkp123</code> to match the contents of
  <code>user</code>&rsquo;s home directory.
</p>
<p>
  To restore from backup, run the following command, again from the
  host:
</p>
  <blockquote>
    <code>rsync -av -e "ssh -p 8024" ~/bkp123/ user@localhost:/home/user/</code>
  </blockquote>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
  The fictional &ldquo;Zoobar Foundation&rdquo; has set up a simple
  Web application at <code>zoobar.org</code> (inside the BoxesX
  VM), allowing registered users to post profiles and transfer
  &ldquo;zoobar&rdquo; credits between each other. Each registered user
  starts with 10 zoobars.
</p>

<p>
  You will craft a series of attacks on <code>zoobar.org</code> that
  exploit vulnerabilities in the Website&rsquo;s design.  Each attack
  presents a distinct scenario with unique goals and constraints,
  although in some cases you may be able to reuse parts of your
  code.
</p>

<p>
  Although many real-world attackers do not have the source code for
  the Websites they are attacking, you are one of the lucky ones: you
  can find the source code under <code>/var/zoobar/www</code> in the
  BoxesX VM.
</p>

<P>The zoobar server is actually run locally on each of your boxes.
We will run your attacks after wiping clean our own local database of
registered users (except the user named "attacker").  Of course this
means that any data you have added while working on the assignment
will <EM>not</EM> be present during grading.

<H3>Setup</H3>

<p>
  <strong>Browser:</strong> We will grade your project within the
  BoxesX VM, using the Iceweasel browser.  which is installed in
  the Boxes. Therefore, you should test your code in the boxes on this
  browser.  Iceweasel is essentially the same browser as Firefox, but
  under different branding.  Anything that works in iceweasel will
  likely work in (the same version of) Firefox as well.
</p>
<p>
  There are subtle quirks in the way HTML and JavaScript are handled
  by different browsers, and some attacks that work in Internet
  Explorer (for example) may not work in Firefox (and therefore in
  Iceweasel).  In particular, you should use the Mozilla way of
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener">adding
  listeners to events</a>.
</p>

<P><B>Email script</B>. For Attacks A and D, you will need a
  server-side script to automatically email information captured by
  your client-side JavaScript to your user account within the
  Boxes. We have provided this script for you.  Please review the
  instructions at
  <code>http://zoomail.org/sendmail.php</code>
  (open this url from within the Boxes VM) and use that URL in your
  attack scripts to send emails. Again, this server is also being run
  locally on your own boxes machine.  To check your local email use
  the mutt email client (type
<B><KBD>mutt</KBD></B> in the shell to start the client, and follow the instructions).
</P>

<hr/>

<h2>Attack A. Cookie Theft</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a URL starting with 
    <code>http://zoobar.org/users.php?</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    The grader will already be logged in to <code>zoobar.org</code>
    before loading your URL.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your goal is to steal the document cookie and email it
    to yourself using the 
    <code>http://zoomail.org/sendmail.php</code>email script.
    </li>
  <li>
    Except for the browser address bar (which can be different), the
    grader should see a page that looks <em>exactly</em> as it
    normally does when the grader visits
    <code>http://zoobar.org/users.php</code>.
    No changes to the site appearance or extraneous text should be
    visible.  Avoiding the <em style="text-color:#ff0000">red warning
	    text</em> is an important part of this attack. (It&rsquo;s
    ok if the page looks weird briefly before correcting itself.)
  </li>
  <li>Hint: Here is an example attack
      <code>http://zoobar.org/users.php?user=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E</code>
      to use as a starting point.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attack B. Cross-Site Request Forgery</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a short HTML document that the grader will open
    using the browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    The grader will already be logged in to <code>zoobar.org</code>
    before loading your page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer 10 zoobars from the grader&rsquo;s account to the
    &ldquo;<code>attacker</code>&rdquo; account. The browser should be
    redirected to
    <CODE>https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~s/teaching/cs460/2013-fall/</CODE> as soon
    as the transfer is complete (so fast the user might not notice).
  </li>
  <li>
    The location bar of the browser should not contain 
    <code>zoobar.org</code> at any point.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attack C. SQL Injection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a short HTML document that the grader will open
    using the browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    The grader will not be logged in to <code>zoobar.org</code> before
    loading your page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your HTML document should display a form with a text field and a
    button.  The grader will type a username into the text field and
    press the button.
  </li>
  <li>
    As a result, the grader should be logged in
    to <code>zoobar.org</code> as the user whose name was typed in the
    text field.  The browser&rsquo;s location bar should be redirected
    to <code>http://zoobar.org/index.php</code>, and the page should
    look and behave exactly as if the grader had instead typed the
    username and corresponding password in the
    legitimate <code>zoobar.org</code> login form.
  </li>
  <li>
    The name the grader types in will already be registered in the
    with some password.  You do not need to handle the case in which
    the name was not already registered.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hint: What part of the <code>zoobar.org</code> PHP code handles
    the user login and registration, and how does it interface with
    the SQLite database?
  </li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Attack D. Password Theft</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a short HTML document that the grader will open
    using the browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    The grader will not be logged in to <code>zoobar.org</code> before
    loading your page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upon loading your document, the browser should immediately be
    redirected to <code>http://zoobar.org/</code>.  The grader will
    enter a username and password and press the &ldquo;Log in&rdquo;
    button.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the &ldquo;Log in&rdquo; button is pressed, send the username
    and password (separated by a comma) using the
    <code>http://zoomail.org/sendmail.php</code> e-mail script.
  </li>
  <li>
    The login form should appear perfectly normal to the user. No
    extraneous text (e.g., warnings) should be visible, and assuming
    the username and password are correct the login should proceed the
    same way it always does.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hint: The site uses
    <code><a href="http://www.php.net/htmlspecialchars">htmlspecialchars()</A></code>
    to sanitize the reflected username, but something is not quite
    right.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attack E. Profile Worm</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a profile that, when viewed, transfers 1 zoobar
    from the current user to a user called
    &ldquo;<code>attacker</code>&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s an actual
    username) and replaces the profile of the current user with
    itself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your malicious profile must include a witty message to the grader
    to help us see that the profile was replicated.
  </li>
  <li>
    To grade your attack, we will cut and paste the submitted profile
    file into the profile of the "attacker" user and view that profile
    using the grader&rsquo;s account. We will then view the copied profile
    with more accounts, checking for the transfer and
    replication.
  </li>
  <li>
    The transfer and replication should be reasonably fast (under 15
    seconds).  During that time, the grader will not click
    anywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    During the transfer and replication process, 
    the browser&rsquo;s location bar should remain at 
    <code>http://zoobar.org/users.php?user=<em>username</em></code>,
    where <code><em>username</em></code> is the user whose profile is
    being viewed. The visitor should not see any extra graphical user
    interface elements (e.g., frames), and the user whose profile is
    being viewed should appear to have 10 zoobars.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will not be graded on the corner case where the user viewing
    the profile has no zoobars to send.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hint: The site allows a sanitized subset of HTML in profiles, but
    you can get around it.
    This <A href="myspace-advisory.txt">MySpace vulnerability</a> may
    provide some inspiration.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<H2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>
  Create files named <code>a.txt</code>, <code>b.html</code>,
  <code>c.html</code>, <code>d.html</code>, and <code>e.txt</code>,
  containing each of your five attacks.  You may include a
  separate <code>README</code> file.  (We would appreciate any
  feedback you may have on this assignment). As before, you will tar
  up the appropriate files for each part and submit the tarball.</p>

<p>
  The last two attacks are harder than the first three.  We encourage
  you to start early!
</p>


<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
  Each attack is worth up to 4 points.  The entire project will be
  graded out of 20.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Beware of Race Conditions</em>: Depending on how you write your
  code, all five of these attacks could potentially have race
  conditions that affect the success of your attacks. Attacks that
  fail on the grader&rsquo;s browser during grading will receive less
  than full credit.  To ensure that you receive full credit, you
  should wait after making an outbound network request rather than
  assuming that the request will be sent immediately.
</p>
