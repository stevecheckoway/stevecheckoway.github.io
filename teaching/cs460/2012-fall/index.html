<p>This course will cover software vulnerabilities, exploitation
techniques, and mitigation measures. It is designed as a
projects-based course where you will get hands-on experience writing
exploits.</p>

<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>Grades will be determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Projects: 65%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exams: 20%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Homework: 15%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Students are expected to enter this course with a basic knowledge of
operating systems, data structures, and programming in C and (very
basic) C++. Some knowledge of x86 assembly and compilers will be
helpful, but the relevant information will be covered in the course.</p>
<h1>Programming Projects</h1>
<p>The programming projects are meant as a way to get hands-on experience
exploiting software vulnerabilities. You will find that there is quite
a difference between conceptually understanding how to exploit a given
vulnerability and actually producing a working exploit.</p>
<p>The programming projects are designed to be done in groups of 2.
(Working alone is allowed, but discouraged.) Each project will have
both programming and writing components. All group members are
expected to participate fully in both the programming and writing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="project1.html">Project 1</a>: Memory Safety (25% of course grade)</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="project2.html">Project 2</a>: Reverse-engineering (20% of course grade)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project 3: TBD (20% of course grade)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Homework Assignments</h1>
<p>The homework assignments can be done solo or in groups of 2. As
with the projects, all group members are expected to contribute to the
end result.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="hw1.html">Homework 1</a>: Due Tuesday, October&nbsp;9 at 23:59.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="hw2.html">Homework 2</a>: Due Thursday, November&nbsp;29 at 23:59.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Exams</h1>
<p>There will be two in-class exams which, together, are worth 20% of
your grade. The first exam will cover material from the first half of
the course whereas the second exam will cover material from the second
half of the course.</p>
<p>There is no final exam.</p>
<h1>Computer Science Department Academic Integrity</h1>
<p><i>The strength of the university depends on academic and personal
integrity. In your studies, you must be honest and truthful. Ethical
violations include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of
assignments, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices,
unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery
and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair
competition.</i></p>
<p><i>Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded.
Except where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all
homework and programming assignments without the help of others. For
example, you must not look at any other solutions (including program
code) to your homework problems or similar problems. However, you may
discuss assignment specifications with others to be sure you
understand what is required by the assignment.</i></p>
<p><i><b>If</b> your instructor permits using fragments of source code from
outside sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must
properly cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism.
Similarly, your group projects must list everyone who participated.</i></p>
<p><i>Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.</i></p>
<p><i>Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for
particular assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if
you are not sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the
instructor or TA, as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from
other students. (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may have
received.</i></p>
<p><i>Students who cheat will suffer a serious course grade penalty in
addition to being reported to university officials. You must abide by
JHU's Ethics Code: Report any violations you witness to the
instructor. You may consult the associate dean of students and/or the
chairman of the Ethics Board beforehand. For more information, see the
guide on &ldquo;Academic Ethics for Undergraduates&rdquo;
and the <del>Ethics Board web site</del>.</i></p>
