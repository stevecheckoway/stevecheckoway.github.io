You should have received an email inviting you to the “CSCI210 Fall 2021” group on <a href=https://circuitverse.org>CircuitVerse</a>. If you did not, please use this <a href=https://circuitverse.org/groups/2466/invite/sfzCjLKWdmBJFR5WJ2bh1s5T>link</a> to join the group. To start the assignment, click on your name on the upper righthand side of the website. Go to “My Groups” and then select the group for this class and you should see “Lab 5” under assignments. Click the “Start Working” button to start the assignment. After you click “Start Working” you can click “Launch Simulator” to start creating the assignment.<p>You can find more details on how to use the circuitverse website <a href=https://docs.circuitverse.org/#/>here</a>.<h3 id=segment-display>7-Segment Display</h3><p>The input to circuit is a set of 4 signals a3, a2, a1, a0 representing the digits of a 4-bit binary number. The output is a set of the seven signals a, b, c, d, e, f, and g used to drive the seven segments of the LED display. When implemented correctly, your circuit will display value of the input as a hexadecimal digit on the 7 segment display. Below is the display with each segment labeled.<p><img src=7seg.png alt="7-segment display labeled"><p>Each of the outputs can be represented as a boolean function of the four input variables. For example, if the input is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0101</code>, then segments a, b, d, f, and g should be on (1), while c and e are off (0), forming the digit “5” on the display.</section><section><h2 id=implementation-plan>Implementation plan</h2><p>You should use the following plan for implementing this lab.<ol><li>Draw out all the numbers on graph paper first.<li>For each of the segments a–g, write down which numbers correspond to that segment.<li>Build a 4-bit decoder as a subcircuit. You MUST have your decoder as a subcircuit in order to receive full credit for this lab. Documentation for how to create a subcircuit is <a href=https://docs.circuitverse.org/#/subcircuit>here</a>.<li>For each segment, create one or more OR gates (as needed), add the appropriate outputs from the decoder to the OR gate.<li>Keep wires straight or right-angle turns. Pick the order the decoder outputs will go into the OR gates so as to minimize wire crossing.<li>If inadvertent connections are made, undo, don’t try to fix it.</ol><p>Performing step 2 before step 4 is critical. You don’t want to be trying to wire this up while figuring out which decoder outputs you need to OR.<h2 id=submission>Submission</h2><p>Make sure to select the “save online” button to save your project. This will make your project available to us for grading.</section></main>
