You are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to attend every class. Lectures are not recorded and there are no slides. If you are unable to attend class, you should consider asking a classmate to take notes for you.<h3 id=missed-or-late-work-policy>Missed or Late Work Policy</h3><p>Projects are due by 23:59 on the day specified on each project page. You have 3 late days that you can use throughout the semester. Each day that a project is late decreases the number of late days you <em>and</em> your partner have left. If you run out of late days, projects turned in late will receive a score of 0. There will be no exceptions to this policy without prior approval from Prof. Checkoway.<h3 id=electronic-communication-policy>Electronic Communication Policy</h3><p><strong>All electronic communication with course staff should take place on <a href=https://piazza.com/class/jyt32n7mdjkw2>Piazza</a></strong> unless emails are specifically requested by the staff. Course staff may, from time to time, respond to emails, but a response to one email does not guarantee a response to a second. <strong>Use <a href=https://piazza.com/class/jyt32n7mdjkw2>Piazza</a>!</strong><h3 id=collaboration-policy>Collaboration Policy</h3><p>You are allowed, and encouraged, to work in groups of size two on all projects. You are free to have different groups for different projects. You are not allowed to work with anyone outside your group. Doing so is academic misconduct.<h3 id=academic-integrity-policy>Academic Integrity Policy</h3></section><section><h2 id=religious-holidays>Religious Holidays</h2></section><section><h2 id=academic-deadlines>Academic Deadlines</h2><p>See the <a href=https://www.oberlin.edu/registrar/academic-calendar>academic calendar</a>.</section><section><h2 id=grading>Grading</h2></section></main>
