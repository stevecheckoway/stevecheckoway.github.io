You’re allowed to work by yourself, but I highly recommend working with a partner. Click on the <a href=https://classroom.github.com/g/V8NaH7X7>assignment link</a>. One partner should create a new team. The second partner should click the link and choose the appropriate team. (Please don’t choose the wrong team, there’s a maximum of two people and if you join the wrong one, you’ll prevent the correct person from joining.)<p>Once you have accepted the assignment and created/joined a team, you can clone the repository on clyde and begin working. But before you do, read the entire assignment.<p>Be sure to ask any questions on <a href>Piazza</a>.<h3 id=submission>Submission</h3><p>To submit your homework, you must commit and push to GitHub before the deadline.<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> should contain<ul><li>The names of both partners (or just your name if you worked alone…but please don’t work alone if you can manage it).</ul><h2 id=part-1>Part 1</h2><p>You’re going to write some regular expressions for use with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">egrep(1)</code>. Each regex will appear in its own two-line file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.1</code> through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.7</code>.<p>The first line of the file will be a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>shebang</a> line telling the OS to run the file as an argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">egrep(1)</code>. (This is provided for you and you shouldn’t change it.) The second line of each file is your regular expression. Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XXX</code> with the regular expression you want.<p>Write regular expressions that print out the following when run on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">words</code>.<ol><li>All words that contain exactly one of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code> (without duplicates).<li>All words that contain the lowercase vowels <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code> in that order. (The words may contain repeated vowels as long as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aeiou</code> is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence>subsequence</a>.)<li>All words that are exactly 22 lowercase letters long.<li>All words that are made up of only pairs of consonant-vowels like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Banana</code> and are at least 6 letters long. You may consider vowels to be just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code> (and their uppercase versions).<li>All words that have a 4-letter sequence repeated (without overlapping).<li>All words that start and end with the same 3 letter sequence (possibly overlapping).<li>All words that end with their first 3 letters reversed like “detected” (possibly overlapping).</ol><p>[<strong>Hint:</strong> For 5–7, you will want to use one or more back references.]<h2 id=part-2>Part 2</h2><p>You’re going to write some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed(1)</code> scripts to perform the following actions. As with <a href=#part-1>Part 1</a>, these will take the form of two-line text files named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.1</code> through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.9</code>.<p>The first line is again a shebang line, this time telling it to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed(1)</code>. Where noted below, it also contains the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code> flag. The second line is the sed command to run. Initially, it’s the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q</code> command which just quits. You should replace this with your own command. All parts can be solved with a single sed command.<ol><li>Replace all instances of “snow fall” or “wind chill” in each line with “summertime”. You’ll want to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code> to match the boundaries of the words.<li>Assuming the input is a dictionary file like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">words</code> (one per line, alpha order), print out all words between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computer</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">science</code>. (For this one, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> flag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code> has been added.)<li>Replaces all instances of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Teh</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teh</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the</code>, but only in standalone words.<li>Move the last word on a line to the front.<li>Find lines where a word has been repeated on the same line and replace that line with a repeated word. Don’t print the other lines. (For this one, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> flag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code> has been added.)<li>Convert C block comments that are on one line and at the end into a line comment. You should preserve everything between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/*</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*/</code>, including spaces. So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/* add things up */</code> would become <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">// add things up </code> (there are two space before on either side of “add things up”).<li>Only print out lines that contain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cs 241</code>, but change that to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSCI 241</code>. Make sure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cs</code> is the start of a word and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">241</code> is the end of a word. (For this one, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> flag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-n</code> has been added.)<li>Take the previous, but modify it to handle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CS</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSCI</code> with any number of spaces (including 0) and with any type of capitalization, and any 3-digit number (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cScI151</code> becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSCI 151</code>)<li>Truncate all lines after exactly 20 characters.</ol></main>
