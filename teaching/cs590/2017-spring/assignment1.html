Note that <em>critique</em> does not mean you are merely looking for flaws in the work. Since these will all be good, if not great, pieces of writing, I don’t expect you to find too much to criticize. However, if you find flaws, by all means write them down. Nor is a critique merely a summary. You should be analyzing the work.<h2 id=collaboration>Collaboration</h2><p>You must write your own critique. Unlike traditional homework assignments, you are encouraged to read your peers’ critiques and make suggestions for improvement. These suggestions can take the form of:<ul><li>Suggestions on content (e.g., “you should expand on this point” or “you should discuss how X relates to Y”);<li>Suggestions on organization (e.g., “the paper would have a better logical flow if you moved these paragraphs earlier”); and<li>Suggestions on spelling and grammar.</ul><h2 id=the-assignment>The Assignment</h2><p>First, choose a general audience science or technology written piece of work. This can came from the <em>Science</em> or <em>Technology</em> sections of newspapers, magazines, or web sites as long as they are of high quality. For example,<ul><li><a href=http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/index.html>New York Times</a><li><a href=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/science/scientific-research/13004000-topic.html>Chicago Tribune</a><li><a href=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/science>Huffington Post</a><li><a href=https://www.scientificamerican.com/>Scientific American</a></ul><p>Next, write a critique which addresses at least the following (related) points:<ul><li>What is the main point the paper makes? Express it in your own words; do not simply extract one or two sentences from the abstract or introduction.<li>What is this important?<li>What are the open problems that are discussed?<li>Which open problems do <em>you</em> think are not addressed?<li>Is the paper well-written? If not, what would make the paper more clear?</ul><h2 id=format>Format</h2><p>Your critique should be at least a page and a half but no more than two pages long (not counting the bibliography). Use 11 pt font with a 1 in margin, single spaced. The critique must contain a bibliography wherein you include full bibliographic references to everything you cite. The bibliography can push your critique over two pages.<p>You must use <span class=tex>L<span class=raise>a</span>T<span class=drop>e</span>X</span> and <span class=tex>B<span class=ib>ib</span>T<span class=drop>e</span>X</span> to format your critique and bibliography. You may use these files as a template: <a href=assignment1.tex>assignment1.tex</a> <a href=references.bib>references.bib</a>.<p>Your critique must be <strong>professional</strong>: check your grammar and run a spell-checker–including one last time before submitting. You also need to clearly identify the article and any other source to which you refer.<h2 id=submitting>Submitting</h2><p>Submit a PDF of your critique using Blackboard before the deadline.</main>
