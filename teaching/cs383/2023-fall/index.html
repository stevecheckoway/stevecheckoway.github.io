Per the <a href=#collaboration-policy>collaboration policy</a>, you are free to work with other students on the homeworks, but you must write up your own solutions.<p><strong>All of your written solutions must be typeset.</strong> You are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to use the <span class=tex>L<span class=raise>a</span>T<span class=drop>e</span>X</span> typesetting system to write up your solutions, but you are free to use other tools (such as Microsoft Word). See the <a href=#resources>resources</a> below for more information on <span class=tex>L<span class=raise>a</span>T<span class=drop>e</span>X</span>.<p>In addition to written solutions, you will also produce DFAs, NFAs, PDAs, and Turing machines using <a href=https://www.jflap.org>JFLAP</a>.</section><section><h2 id=course-materials>Course Materials</h2><h3 id=textbooks>Textbooks</h3><ul><li>Required. Michael Sipser. <a href=https://math.mit.edu/~sipser/book.html>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a>, 3rd edition. This book is <em>very</em> expensive right now for some reason. I <em>strongly</em> recommend getting an international edition or a used version. The 2nd edition of the book is cheeper and all of the material we’ll be using is in the second edition.<li>Optional.

You have 3 late days that you can use throughout the semester. If you run out of late days, homeworks turned in late will receive a score of 0. You are responsible for keeping track of your late days. There will be no exceptions to this policy without prior approval from Prof. Checkoway.<p><strong>College policy prohibits accepting any work after the scheduled final exam time for a course without an incomplete.</strong><h3 id=electronic-communication-policy>Electronic Communication Policy</h3><p><strong>All electronic communication with course staff should take place on <a href=https://edstem.org/us/courses/45865/discussion/>Ed</a></strong> unless emails are specifically requested by the staff.
