Per the <a href=#collaboration-policy>collaboration policy</a>, you are free to work with other students on the homeworks, but you must write up your own solutions.<p><strong>All of your written solutions must be typeset.</strong> You are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to use the <span class=tex>L<span class=raise>a</span>T<span class=drop>e</span>X</span> typesetting system to write up your solutions, but you are free to use other tools (such as Microsoft Word). See the <a href=#resources>resources</a> below for more information on <span class=tex>L<span class=raise>a</span>T<span class=drop>e</span>X</span>.<p>In addition to written solutions, you will also produce DFAs, NFAs, PDAs, and Turing machines using <a href=https://www.jflap.org>JFLAP</a>.</section><section><h2 id=course-materials>Course Materials</h2><h3 id=textbooks>Textbooks</h3><ul><li>Required. Michael Sipser. <a href=https://math.mit.edu/~sipser/book.html>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a>, 3rd edition. This book is <em>very</em> expensive right now for some reason. I <em>strongly</em> recommend getting an international edition or a used version. The 2nd edition of the book is cheeper and all of the material we’ll be using is in the second edition.<li>Optional. Richard Hammack <a href=https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/>Book of Proof</a> (available online).</ul><h3 id=resources>Resources</h3><p><a href=https://www.jflap.org>JFLAP</a> is software that you will use for building the machines we will be discussing in class.<p><span class=tex>L<span class=raise>a</span>T<span class=drop>e</span>X</span> is a typesetting system which you are encouraged to use to write up solutions to the homework.

I <em>strongly</em> recommend you learn to use it well.</section><section><h2 id=course-policies>Course Policies</h2><h3 id=covid-19-policy>COVID-19 Policy</h3><p>This policy supersedes all of the other policies (except for any policies mandated by the College).<p>No one wants to be dealing with the pandemic at the same time as we try to do everything that’s required of us. We should all recognize just how hard this situation is for everyone. If you need any accommodation from me, just let me know. In particular, if you need additional time on any assignments or exams, just let me know, in advance, if at all possible.<p>You are never required to tell me about any health issues, including if you have COVID-19. You are welcome to talk to me about anything you’d like. I may not have answers to questions, but I can probably point you in right direction.<h3 id=attendance-policy>Attendance Policy</h3><p>You are not <em>required</em> to attend; however, you receive points for participation in each class period that count toward your final grade. You can miss up to 3 days without penalty. Research indicates that students who attend class are more likely to be successful. You are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to attend every class. If you are unable to attend class, you should consider asking a classmate to take notes for you.<h3 id=missed-or-late-work-policy>Missed or Late Work Policy</h3><p>Homework is due by 23:59 on the day specified on each homework page. You have 3 late days that you can use throughout the semester. Each day that a homework is late decreases the number of late days you <em>and</em> your partner have left. If you run out of late days, homeworks turned in late will receive a score of 0. You are responsible for keeping track of your late days. There will be no exceptions to this policy without prior approval from Prof. Checkoway.<p><strong>College policy prohibits accepting any work after the scheduled final exam time for a course without an incomplete.</strong><h3 id=electronic-communication-policy>Electronic Communication Policy</h3><p><strong>All electronic communication with course staff should take place on <a href=#>Piazza</a></strong> unless emails are specifically requested by the staff. Course staff may, from time to time, respond to emails, but a response to one email does not guarantee a response to a second. <strong>Use <a href=#>Piazza</a>!</strong><h3 id=collaboration-policy>Collaboration Policy</h3><p>You are allowed, and encouraged, to work in groups of size two on all homeworks. You are free to have different groups for different assignments. You are allowed to talk to anyone in the course about the assignments; however, you are not allowed to share solutions with anyone outside your group. Doing so is academic misconduct.<h3 id=academic-integrity-policy>Academic Integrity Policy</h3><p>You must adhere to the Oberlin College <a href=https://www.oberlin.edu/dean-of-students/student-conduct/academic-integrity>Academic Integrity Policy</a>. Please familiarize yourself with the Honor Code.<h3 id=religious-holiday-observance-policy>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</h3><p>Students wishing to be excused from class in order to observe religious holidays must follow the Oberlin College <a href=https://www.oberlin.edu/religious-and-spiritual-life/resources/religious-holiday-observance-policy>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</a>.</section></main>
