As with the other homeworks, these should be completed either individually or in groups of two. However, if you’re working with a partner on the interpreter, you should work with the same partner on all parts.<p>The details of the MiniScheme project can be found <a href=minischeme.html>here</a>.</section><section><h2 id=course-materials>Course Materials</h2><h3 id=required-texts>Required Texts</h3><p>We’ll be using <a href=https://htdp.org/2020-8-1/Book/index.html><em>How to Design Programs</em></a> second edition.<h3 id=resources>Resources</h3><ul><li><a href=https://racket-lang.org>Racket</a> is the implementation of Scheme we will be using.

CS 241 is recommended. You should be comfortable with programming with higher level languages, such as Python or Java. No prior experience with Scheme or functional programming is expected.<h3 id=covid-19-policy>COVID-19 Policy</h3><p>This policy supersedes all of the other policies (except for any policies mandated by the College).<p>No one wants to be dealing with the pandemic at the same time as we try to do everything that’s required of us. We should all recognize just how hard this situation is for everyone. If you need any accommodation from me, just let me know. In particular, if you need additional time on any assignments or exams, just let me know, in advance, if at all possible.<p>You are never required to tell me about any health issues, including if you have COVID-19. You are welcome to talk to me about anything you’d like. I may not have answers to questions, but I can probably point you in right direction.<h3 id=attendance-policy>Attendance Policy</h3><p>You are not <em>required</em> to attend; however, you receive points for participation in each class period that count toward your final grade. You can miss up to 3 days without penalty. Research indicates that students who attend class are more likely to be successful. You are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to attend every class. Lectures are recorded. If you are unable to attend class, you should watch the recording or consider asking a classmate to take notes for you.<h3 id=missed-or-late-work-policy>Missed or Late Work Policy</h3><p>Homework is due by 23:59 on the day specified on each homework page. You have 3 late days that you can use throughout the semester. Each day that a homework is late decreases the number of late days you <em>and</em> your partner have left. If you run out of late days, homeworks turned in late will receive a score of 0. You are responsible for keeping track of your late days. There will be no exceptions to this policy without prior approval from Prof. Checkoway.<h3 id=electronic-communication-policy>Electronic Communication Policy</h3><p><strong>All electronic communication with course staff should take place on <a href=https://piazza.com/oberlin/summer2021/cs275>Piazza</a></strong> unless emails are specifically requested by the staff. Course staff may, from time to time, respond to emails, but a response to one email does not guarantee a response to a second. <strong>Use <a href=https://piazza.com/oberlin/summer2021/cs275>Piazza</a>!</strong><h3 id=collaboration-policy>Collaboration Policy</h3><p>You are allowed, and encouraged, to work in groups of size two on all homeworks. You are free to have different groups for different assignments with the exception of the MiniScheme interpreter which should be completed with the same partner (or individually). You are allowed to talk to anyone in the course about the assignments; however, you are not allowed to share solutions with anyone outside your group. Doing so is academic misconduct.<h3 id=academic-integrity-policy>Academic Integrity Policy</h3><p>You must adhere to the Oberlin College <a href=https://www.oberlin.edu/dean-of-students/student-conduct/academic-integrity>Academic Integrity Policy</a>. Please familiarize yourself with the Honor Code.<h3 id=religious-holiday-observance-policy>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</h3><p>Students wishing to be excused from class in order to observe religious holidays must follow the Oberlin College <a href=https://www.oberlin.edu/religious-and-spiritual-life/resources/religious-holiday-observance-policy>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</a>.</section></main>
