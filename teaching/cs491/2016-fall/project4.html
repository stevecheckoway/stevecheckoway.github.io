No late days allowed, no exceptions!<h2 id=goal>Goal</h2><p>Like <a href=project3.html>Project 3</a>, the goal of this project is to reverse engineer the binary and exploit it.<p>You are given a single <code class=highlighter-rouge>target</code> binary and a data file <code class=highlighter-rouge>model.dat</code> accepted by <code class=highlighter-rouge>target</code>. Your goal is to write a <code class=highlighter-rouge>sploit.dat</code> file so that when <code class=highlighter-rouge>target</code> is run on <code class=highlighter-rouge>sploit.dat</code>, you end up with a shell. Further more, once the shell exits, the program should finish running without any errors.<h2 id=collaboration>Collaboration</h2><p>You must work on this project by yourself. You must not discuss the project with anyone in the class besides course staff nor with anyone outside of class. This includes discussing what particular vulnerabilities in the target are! You may use online resources for general reference, but not to search for solutions to specific questions posed in this project.<h2 id=the-environment>The Environment</h2><p>Your exploits should work on bertvm or ernievm.<h2 id=the-target>The Target</h2><p>Each time you run the target, it will produce a different, ridiculous, randomly-generated string.<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class=highlight><pre class=highlight><code><span class=nv>$ </span>./target model.dat
But <span class=k>if </span>you need to convince an enemy to work with you, it<span class=s1>'s a good idea to make use of all costs.
$ ./target model.dat
The key to hand-to-hand combat is to be able to keep an eye on your employees during the off-hours and keep listening.
</span></code></pre></div></div><h2 id=the-assignment>The Assignment</h2><p>There are two parts for this assignment.<ol><li>Create a <code class=highlighter-rouge>sploit-small.dat</code> that is as small as possible to (a) cause a shell to be launched; and (b) exits the program without crashing when the shell exits. <code class=highlighter-rouge>sploit-small.dat</code> should be less than 100 bytes.<li>Create <code class=highlighter-rouge>sploit.dat</code> which first spawns a shell, and then, when the shell exits, continues the <code class=highlighter-rouge>target</code> program as normal. In particular, after the shell exits, it should print one of the randomly-generated lines.</ol><h2 id=deliverables>Deliverables</h2><p>When you are finished, you should run <code class=highlighter-rouge>submit.sh</code> to submit your code.</main>
