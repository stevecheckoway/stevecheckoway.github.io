<h1>Overview</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="readings.html">Readings</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This course will explore recent advances in software security.
Students will read, analyze, and discuss recent and/or important
computer security papers. A variety of topics will be discussed, based
on student interest. Possible topics include low-level software
security, web security, applied cryptography, embedded system
security, language-based security, and privacy.</p>
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>Grades will be determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Paper summaries: 10%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project and presentation: 40%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Class participation: 50%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Students are required to have taken and passed a graduate course in
computer security. Students are expected to be familiar with low-level
software security, operating systems, C, and assembly.</p>
<h1>Papers</h1>
<p>Reading, analyzing, and discussing academic papers is the primary
component of this course. To that end, each student is expected to
read <i>every</i> paper and come to class prepared to discuss them.
To facilitate an interesting discussion, a written summary of the
day's papers are due by 6&nbsp;am on the day of the class.</p>
<h2>Reading papers</h2>
<p>Reading and comprehending a research paper can be a challenging
activity. When reading a paper, keep these questions in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What problem does this work try to solve? (Note that this isn't a
question about what technical problem the paper overcomes.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is this an important problem?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why is prior work (if any) insufficient to solve the problem?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is the proposed solution?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What technical contribution does the proposed solution contain?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How is the proposed solution evaluated?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is the evaluation reasonable?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How would you continue this line of research? (I.e., what future
work would you do if you were working on this topic.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Paper summaries</h2>
<p>You will write a structured paper summary for each paper we read in
the course. The summary is due at 6&nbsp;am on the day of the class. If for
whatever reason you cannot do so, you must contact the instructor no
later than the day before; no nonemergency exceptions. Use the
<a href="summary.txt">summary template</a> to write your summary and turn them in
using <a href="https://blackboard.uic.edu">BlackBoard</a>. You should write about
a paragraph for each section in the template. <b>Summaries should not
consist of sentences copied from the paper. Use your own words to
describe the key ideas.</b></p>
<h2>Paper discussions</h2>
<p>We will discuss the papers we read in class. This is a key component
of the course. Everybody <i>must</i> participate. The paper summaries are
intended to help you focus your thoughts about the papers.</p>
<h1>Research project</h1>
<p>The other major component of the course is a research project that you
may do in any area of computer security, including those not covered
in class. <b>The project will consist of original research.</b></p>
<p>You will give a 10&ndash;15 minute presentation on the last week of class
about your project and submit a short 5&ndash;8 page writeup (in USENIX
format). The goal is to have the resulting writeup to be of sufficient
quality and novelty to submit to a workshop or conference in computer
security.</p>
<p>For the project, you will form teams of three. A team of two or four
students may be required depending on class size, but they are
strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>Once you have picked a team, you will write a one-page project
proposal, due in class on Thursday January&nbsp;21, and a two-page project
status update, due in class on Thursday March&nbsp;3.</p>
<p>Project presentations will take place in class on Tuesday, April&nbsp;26
and Thursday April&nbsp;28. If you are presenting on Tuesday, your final
report is due on Thursday and if you are presenting on Thursday, your
final report is due on Tuesday.</p>
<h1>Exams</h1>
<p>There are no exams.</p>
<h1>Collaboration Policy</h1>
<p>You may work with your assigned project team on the project. It is
expected that all students in a team contribute to all parts of the
project, including giving the final presentation.</p>
<h1>Late Policy</h1>
<p>The deadlines for the project presentation and writeup are hard: no
late assignments will be accepted.</p>
<h1>Academic Integrity</h1>
<p>Students are expected to do their own work. Cheating will not be
tolerated and any student who engages in forbidden conduct will be
subjected to the <a href="http://dos.uic.edu/conductforstudents.shtml">disciplinary process</a>. Cheaters will receive a failing grade in the
course.</p>
